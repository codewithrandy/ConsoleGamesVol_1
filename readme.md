# CONSOLE GAMES VOL. I
This project contains a collection of simple console / text based games coded in Python. 
These mini-projects are designed to be easy-to-follow learning projects for beginners.

This is an ongoing project that I will be including in a course that I currently have in development on How to Code in Python.
My plan is to create a companion Vol. II that will focus on GUI games and PyGame.
